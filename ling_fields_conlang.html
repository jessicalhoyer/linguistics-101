<h1>conlanging</h1>
<p>Conlanging may arguably not be a field of linguistics, but it is a great job opportunity. Furthermore, it's a job that not many people think of when they're watching movies and TV shows with non-Earth languages - sometimes the writers of the series use gibberish or even an obscure language that not many people will recognize, but sometimes, the writers hire a linguist to construct a language for them.</p>
<br/>
<p>This is where the term "conlanging" comes from. Conlang stands for "constructed language". And although conlanging seems to be a relatively new term and a new field for linguists, it actually has a longer history than you think.</p>
<br/>
<p>One of the first and most famous conlangers is none other than J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of <u>The Silmarillion</u>, <u>The Hobbit</u>, and <u>The Lord of the Rings</u>. His languages Quenya and Sindarin are among the most famous constructed languages and have one of the most documented grammars and vocabularies of any constructed language.</p>
<br/>
<p>Other famous constructed languages include Klingon (Star Trek), Na'vi (Avatar), and Dothraki (Game of Thrones). However, constructed languages do not just include languages made up for fantasy settings, but also <b>auxiliary languages</b>. An auxiliary language is a language invented for international communication. The most famous auxlang is Esperanto.</p>
<br/>
<p>Conlanging is hard work, as it takes a lot of research to properly construct a believable language, especially if it's a language not based on any other existing languages (an a priori language) as opposed to being based on an existing language (a posteriori).</p>
<br/>
<p>In his book, <u>The Art of Language Invention</u>, author David Peterson describes how to construct a language. David Peterson himself is credited with fleshing out the languages of Dothraki and Valyrian from the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV series (which are themselves based on the book series, <u>A Song of Ice and Fire</u> by George R. R. Martin) as well as the language of the Dark Elves in <em>Thor: The Dark World</em>. If you'd like to look into constructing your own language (or even getting a crash course in linguistics itself), I highly recommend reading his book!</p>
